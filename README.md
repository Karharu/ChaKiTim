# ðŸŽ® Java Text-Based RPG

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
A basic Java-based RPG played through the terminal, created for our Object-Oriented Programming 1 (OOP1) course. It serves as our capstone project, initiated on September 16, 2025, and is currently under development. The game showcases key OOP principles like class structures, object interactions, inheritance, and modular architecture.

âš  Heads-up: The project is in its initial build phase. Itâ€™s not playable yet, as we're still constructing the core mechanics and foundational systems.
